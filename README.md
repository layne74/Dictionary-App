# Dictionary app

App was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to my dictionary app

## How to install

If you dont want to download the node_modules file, then skip this step. Navigate to the directory that you saved the download, open cmd and type` npm install` where the package.json file is located. This will setup the node_modules folder, how long this takes is different for everyone but you will see a progress indicator telling you what is happening in the console.

## Launch the dictionary

While in the same folder as before. Open cmd and run `npm start` . This runs the dictionary in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
